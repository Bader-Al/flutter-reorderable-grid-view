## 3.1.0
üêõ **Fixed Bugs**

  still works
* an exception would be if your content is scrollable outside your `GridView`

‚≠êÔ∏è **New features**

* `enableScrollingWhileDragging`
    * **IMPORTANT**: You have to add a `GlobalKey` to your `GridView` before autoscroll can work

## 2.1.0

‚≠êÔ∏è **New features**

* added two new parameters for `ReorderableBuilder`:
    * `onDragStarted`: Called when user starts dragging a child
    * `onDragEnd`: Called when user releases dragged child

ü¶ô **Behavior changed**

* `onReorder` won't be called anymore when the dragged child didn't change his original position

## 2.0.3

üêõ **Fixed Bugs**

* Wrong behavior after updating children (especially the key) and using drag and drop
* For every update of a child, a new listener was added

## 2.0.2

* Downgraded Dart-version from `2.16.1` to `2.16.0`

## 2.0.2-dev.2

* second try to solve dependency issue

## 2.0.2-dev.1

* trying to solve dependency problem

## 2.0.1

* updated pubspec

## 2.0.0

* Official Release of 2.0.0
* There are breaking changes in this release:
    * Currently I don't support the widget `Wrap`
    * I removed all custom widgets for `GridView`
        * instead you can use `ReorderableBuilder` as a Wrapper for all `GridView` of Flutter
        * See more on Getting Started or the example app

## 2.0.0-dev.5

* last release candidate! (if there aren't some critical bugs)
* this release includes a change for the function `onReorder`
    * the function gives always a list of entities containing the old and new index for children
    * this case had to be done to ensure correct animations when there are locked children (`lockedIndices`)
    * see more on the example app in `main.dart`
* multiple other bugs were solved when changing positions or adding/removing children
* added more commentaries to classes
* Before publishing the official `2.0.0`, the following things will be done:
    * Unit and Widget tests
    * some more refactoring, also in favor of making the testing easier
    * Refactoring example app
    * ReadMe gets a whole new update

## 2.0.0-dev.4

* Removed `AnimatedGridViewBuilder` and `AnimatedReorderableBuilder` because there were some problems splitting the
  logic for animation while dragging and adding/removing items
* `ReorderableBuilder` is making all the animation
    * to disable drag and drop, just make `enableDraggable` to false
* improved the performance
* Todo:
    * Refactoring of code
    * more testing
    * Widget tests + Unit Tests (?)
    * updating examples
    * updating read me
